"""
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Thinking Process & Whiteboard
I was practicing questions related to the use of two pointers,
My initial thought was what if I replace every 0 with a non-zero number and exchange there position,
then I started visualing, and finally made a thought. 
```
left = 0
right = 1        
while right < len(nums):
    if nums[left] != 0:
        left += 1
    elif nums[right] == 0:
        right += 1 
    else: 
        nums[right] != 0
        nums[left] = nums[right]
        nums[right] = 0
        left += 1
        right += 1 
    return nums
``` 

- I got Index error,the reason behind the error is if there is no 0 in the input,the left pointer goes forward, but right pointer stays the same. 
- Finally breaking the code when left pointer goes out of index. Now I knew, the base logic is correct, I just have to move right pointer everytime.
- I switched to 'for' loop, using 'right' as the index of my for loop, made sure it moves everytime,the left pointer only moves when the loop finds a non-zero number,
- As the loop goes forward both pointers move together until the loop hit any '0', as soon as zero comes in the way the left pointer stops,and right move ahead. 
- When the loop runs again and find the nums[right] != 0, it swaps the position of left and right number respectively. Explained by a diagram below.

            if nums[right] != 0:

                left += 1
